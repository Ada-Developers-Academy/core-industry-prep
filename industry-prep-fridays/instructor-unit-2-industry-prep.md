## Code Reviews

In the provided activity, the students are broken into teams of 2-3 and practice creating branches, adding code, and creating PRs.

Students then review the code submitted, making comments on the code to practice the code review process and gain familiarity with the Github PR workflow.

With the addition of another function, this could be scaled up to 4-person groups.  

The activity is expected to take ~1 hour.
