# Instructor: Activity: Current Events

The goal of this activity is to bring in students who have never been welcome to discuss current events and technology.

There are a lot of barriers to being able to talk about these thoughts openly.

- BIPOC are punished for bringing up topics that "cause problems" for white people
- Women are socialized to avoid conflict, or to avoid conversations or opinions that could create conflict
- Trans people are asked to minimize themselves, and to not ask for rights
- Immigrants, especially from the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South), are deprioritized or disregarded
- Many groups face prejudice around how they're able to engage in critical discussion, implying that it's outside of someone's:
    - role
    - intelligence
    - interest
- White supremacy culture believes that racism, sexism, transphobia, ableism, and more should not be discussed in the workplace

The best attitude for this activity is, "Of course you can engage with current events in technology. Your ideas, learnings, engagement, and understanding of the news are valid and expected. You have the expected role, intelligence, interest, place, and identity that is appropriate for this conversation."

Simon note: These folks have an inherently more valuable voice for this conversation _because_ of their marginalization. :)

## Example Topics

Simon Note: These are topics I imagine that students are interested in and have always been interested in, and we can anticipate them being brought up:

1. Tech and wealth disparity
1. Tech and climate change
1. Tech and systemic racism
1. Tech and accessibility
1. Tech and systemic sexism, misogyny, misogynoir
1. Tech and neoliberalism, late-stage capitalism, globlization
1. Tech and unionization, workers' rights
1. Start-up culture

## Balance the Possibility of Triggering Discussion With Enthusiasm for Successes

When introducing this topic, it is **important** to not focus on the fact that current events may be triggering. Everyone knows that tech is full of unsavory topics and hate already, and it only triggers marginalized folks more to spend time waxing on about harm.

<br/>

Clearly introduce our safety tools (disengagement, content warning). Make it as plain as any other requirement. Don't add fluff or try to emotionally comfort people through this-- answer any questions, but emphasizing it in a weird way is weird. It makes the room feel heavier than it should.

<br/>

Always create a possibility to find news that celebrates the accomplishments of marginalized folks in tech. Equally do not add fluff to this, or it will sound like coddling an adult to only find the Disney movies of tech. Make this possibility also something plain-as-day, matter-of-fact.

### !end-callout

Encourage engagement with the topics:

- If there's happiness, encourage happy news!
- If there's energy around critical news, encourage the discussion!

It's intentional that the format of this is small conversations, not a large group. These can be really personal.

## Meta

The list of triggers comes from [a trigger warning guide](https://trigger-warning-guide.tumblr.com/triggers). I pruned some topics from my own POV.

## Facilitation Notes to Consider: Ada's Company Partners and "Don't Yuck My Yum"

The trickiest balance of this entire thing is to center the activity around discussion of current events outside our control. Students are doing the right thing by acknowledging the current events exist.

<br/>

I anticipate that many current events are about Ada company partners, and are critical of them. It's important to _not_ center around "is this a bad company, and what if I or someone I know interns at this bad company?" because those things are outside individual control. Also, discussion should not lead to the judgment of others. Bringing an article decrying Google (example) should not mean that they hate Google and everyone who works at Google, and that they never want to work at Google.

<br/>

If appropriate, it may be helpful to bring up:

- Working at a tech giant happens! You survive and thrive!! And it's your individual journey to figure out how you fit into that, but being employed is always a good thing when surviving under capitalism.
- "Don't yuck my yum"-- bring up good news, but don't knock me for liking something
