# Linux Manual

## Introduction

Early in the Ada curriculum we learned the basics of linux commands in the [Intro to Command Line lesson](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/core-unit-1/blob/main/intro-to-dev-environment/intro-to-command-line.md) in the **Intro to Dev Environment** topic. We have used linux commands extensively throughout our programming journey.

As we prepare for internship, we will review the commands we know. We will also review how to use the linux manual (`man`) to learn about linux commands. 

To review linux commands and the linux manual, review this [Linux Basics document](http://alyssahursh.com/docs/linux-basics.html). This resource was created by Alyssa Hursh, an Ada alum and mentor and software engineer at Amazon. As you review the document, use the check list below to record your learnings.

We also encourage you to review your class' lightning talk about the Linux Manual.
