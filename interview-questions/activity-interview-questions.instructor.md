# Instructor: Activity: Interview Questions

I'm recommending making a spreadsheet that lists everyone's names in it for:

1. Clarity of reading and submission for the student's experience (so they can submit their questions easily, and find other questions easily)
1. Accountability (so we can tell how engaged they are and how long it takes for them to find two questions)
