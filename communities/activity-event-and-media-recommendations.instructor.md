# Instructor: Activity: Event and Media Recommendations

Presentations are exciting because it gives students an opportunity to verbalize what gets them excited.

Getting the slides to auto-advance every 30 seconds is important. This helps moderate the student pace; no student should "hijack" the presentation, or take up too much space. Auto-advance helps prevent facilitation.

Thirty seconds is recommended because the recommendations can be short. Feel free to adjust, but be mindful that the students are asked to create three slides. ðŸ’€

The goal of the slide deck is to ensure that all materials are available offline, after the activity.

Don't forget that students are allowed to pass their turn. It's valid to pass your turn for this activity. This activity is low-stakes, and should only add to someone's life. It's possible that students:

- Ran out of time, because the world is so big and vast and large!
- Uncomfortable sharing

## Recommendations Can Be Mostly Anything

All the below are cool IMO, even if they're not obvious:

- Specific hashtags on social media
- Bots (Twitter bots, etc)
- Meme pages
- Weird artsy stuff
- Movies/TV Shows

If it can help build a personal connection to tech, then it's chill.

## The Reflection Question

This question is to gently prompt/heavily suggest the reader to consider the media they surround themselves with.

I've chosen the "tasklist" challenge type so that readers aren't obligated to share details. (These details can reveal the personal work that we need to do, and this isn't necessarily the space to unpack that!)
