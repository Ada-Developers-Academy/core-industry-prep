# Instructor: Activity: Current Events

The goal of this activity is to bring in students who have never been welcome to discuss current events and technology.

There are a lot of barriers to being able to talk about these thoughts openly.

- BIPOC are punished for bringing up topics that "cause problems" to white people
- Women are socialized to avoid conflict, or to avoid conversations or opinions that could create conflict
- Trans people are asked to minimize themselves, and to not ask for rights
- Many groups face prejudice around how they're able to engage in critical discussion
- White supremacy culture believes that racism, sexism, transphobia, ableism, and more should not be discussed in the workplace

The best attitude for this activity is, "Of course you can engage with current events in technology. Your ideas, learnings, engagement, and understanding of the news are valid and expected."

## Balance the Possibility of Triggering Discussion With Enthusiasm for Successes

When introducing this topic, it **important** to not focus on the fact that current events may be triggering. Everyone knows it, and it only triggers marginalized folks more to spend time waxing on about harm.

<br/>

Clearly introduce our safety tools (disengagement, content warning). Make it as plain as any other requirement.

<br/>

Always create a possibility to find news that celebrates the accomplishments of marginalized folks in tech.

### !end-callout

Encourage engagement with the topics:

- If there's happiness, encourage happy news!
- If there's energy around critical news, encourage the discussion!

It's intentional that the format of this is small conversations/not to a large group. These can be really personal.
