# Activity: Python Mob Programming

## Goal

Our goal is to get back into solving Python problems. We can work on this by employing the programming technique, [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming). In mob programming, one developer is at the keyboard, while the code is projected onto a large screen or shared with the remaining teammates.

## Preparation

The initial driver (usually the facilitator or instructor) should determine which Python project to use and clone it.

You may want to set up [Live Share in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share), which may make collaboration smoother.

## Activity Instructions

There will be:

1. One coding problem
1. One driver
1. An ensemble

The driver and ensemble should work together to solve the coding problem.

### Driver Instructions

As the driver, you are at the keyboard.

Keep the following tips in mind:

1. Narrate your thoughts out loud
1. Pause and ask questions when you're uncertain
1. Be willing to try something new and experiment

Follow directions to determine when to switch drivers.

### Ensemble Instructions

As part of the ensemble, you are not at the keyboard, but participating in the code development from afar. You are responsible for being a navigator.

Participating in mob programming will likely feel fun, exciting, and engaging! Mob programming is only effective if the ensemble is vocal and participates.

**Each ensemble member is required to contribute at least one idea during the exercise**.

As an ensemble member, you can do either or both of these options:

1. Participate and watch without taking notes
1. Participate and code along

#### Tips

- Feel free to say something incorrect! The rest of the ensemble members will listen to your suggestion and help out.
- It's better to say or type something than to stay quiet.
- Ask questions! You don't always need to contribute a suggestion. Asking a question or asking to pause is a good way to get more ideas in.
