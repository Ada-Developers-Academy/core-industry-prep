# Instructor: Activity: Specialized Fields

The goal of this is to grow awareness of how expansive the tech field is. Students should see a huge breadth of computing topics, and imagine if their interests fit into any of them.

The list of specialized fields is not comprehensive at all. The topics were chosen vaguely arbitrarily (although Data Science, AI, and ML should be on the list)
