# Activity: Interview Questions

## Goal

Our goal is to compile a series of interview question resources and interview questions.

## Preparation

The facilitator should make a spreadsheet that includes everyone's name, and allows students to notate at least two questions. For example:

| Name | Question #1 | Question #2 |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
|      |             |

The facilitator should also prepare a way to record ideas in part one. Some recommended methods include:

- The word cloud feature of [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)
- Taking notes on a shared document

## Activity Instructions

There are two parts to this activity:

1. Crowdsource interview resources
1. Crowdsource interview questions

### Crowdsource Resources

As a large group, follow directions from the facilitator to create a shared list of interview question resources.

These resources may include:

- Websites made for technical interview preparation
- Newsletters made for technical interview preparation
- Recommended books

If it includes practice interview questions, then it's valid!

### Crowdsource Questions

Individually find and share practice questions. Everyone must contribute at least _two_ questions to the shared document of practice questions.

- One must be a coding question
- The second may be a behavioral question
- There can be overlap or repetition with other entries in the document.

For each coding question, include a link to its original source if possible. For example:

| Name         | Question #1                                                                 | Question #2                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eamonn Finch | [Roman Numeral to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/) | Describe a time when you were working with someone and there was a conflict. What happened, and what was the resolution? |

#### Tips

Begin with looking for questions that are:

- Marked as "easy"
- Centered around:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Hash Tables
  - Sorting

## Your Mileage May Vary

Finding interview questions is an imperfect process. Sometimes, questions aren't appropriate after all. Don't aim for perfection, aim for practice!
