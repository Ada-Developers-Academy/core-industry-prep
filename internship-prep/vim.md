# VIM

## Introduction

In internship, we will learn to use many new tools. One of the tools will be a new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor. To practice quickly getting up to speed with an new tool, in this lesson we will complete a **vim** crash course. 

**Vim** is a powerful and commonly used text editor that is run from the terminal. To learn the basics of using **vim**, complete a short [Vim Crash Course](http://alyssahursh.com/docs/vim-crash-course.html). This resource was created by Alyssa Hursh, an Ada alum and mentor and software engineer at Amazon.

Once you complete the crash course, record your practice using the check list below.
