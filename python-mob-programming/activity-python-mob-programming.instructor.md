# Instructor: Activity: Python Mob Programming

The goal is to get students back into Python mode, and to do it optimistically while getting a good hour of coding in.

This exercise relies on the hypothesis that Python memories will come back after seeing the project code, which will let students be proud of their Python skills and how far they've come. Alternatively, it could remind students that they need to study Python again! Returning to old project ideally feels easier than the first time.

## Simon Recommendation

I recommend coding either of the two Python projects: viewing-party or swap-meet.

I would plan to implement the whole project, as if it were my first time solving it!

You don't have to roleplay/pretend that you don't know the project. My hope is that once the coding starts, people will find that it's easy and fun to participate and ~get nostalgic~ over Python projects.

Make room for question-asking, suggestion-giving, tangent-going, experiment-making moments.

I don't think there's any need to control the pace-- read the room and see what works best for the group. If y'all need to go slowly, go slowly, and if you need to go quickly/smoothly, go quickly and smoothly.

That being said, if you're able to complete the whole project in one session, that would feel really impressive, right?! Celebrate your progress and mention how long it took for the group to make this progress, compared to how many hours the first one might have taken.

## Switching Drivers

Feel free to remain as the driver for the entire activity, especially if the group is engaged. I may suggest changing drivers if the group lacks engagement or investment.

That being said, in case there's a possibility of changing drivers, I'd recommend using VSCode Live Share.

## Alternatives

There's a chance that mob programming for an hour or more ends up feeling stale. If this is the case, an alternative is to get students to do this in small groups.

If this happens, it'll be really good to give clear directions to small groups about when to switch drivers. I recommend either stating "when a wave finishes" or every 15 minutes.
