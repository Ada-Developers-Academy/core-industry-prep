# Git Video Course

## Introduction

At Ada, we teach the basics of using git and github for collaboration. Every company has different norms and expectations around git, gihub, and other version control systems. The video course linked below was created by Alyssa Hursh, an Ada alum and mentor and software engineer at Amazon. This comprehensive git course is based on Alyssa's extensive experience mentoring Ada interns at Amazon. Completion of this course will help set up Ada interns for success at Amazon.
