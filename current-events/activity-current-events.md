# Activity: Current Events

## Goal

Our goal is to create intentional space to discuss current events in technology.

We want to become part of the conversation between technologists that evolves every day.

Through discussion, we should aim to gain awareness of different topics and share what current events are interesting to us.

Everyone will prepare a presentation of three or less slides to introduce a current event topic of your choice.

## Preparation

A slide deck of three or fewer slides should be prepared before activity day. Slide deck requirements are below.

On the day of presentations, we should be prepared to discuss, present, and share in small groups.

Open discussion about current events can affect us in many ways. Everyone should be prepared to engage in discussions however is best for you. This includes disengaging!

## Activity Instructions

1. Find an article/piece of media that describes a current event about technology that interests you.

Current events should be topics actively relevant within the last twelve months. Some examples include:

- A recent news article describing how tech is transforming
- A documentary on some technology that was built in the last year
- A thinkpiece on technology written recently
- Instance of action, resistance, and/or justice related to technology and current events

Avoid fiction, unless it is unambiguously making a direct connection to a current event.

2. Create a slide deck of three or less slides describing the current event.

3. On activity day, follow the facilitator's directions to get into small discussion groups.

4. Within the discussion groups, take turns so that every person introduces their current event topic with their own slide deck.

5. After everyone has presented their current event topic, pick a current event to begin the discussion. Then, work together as a team to discuss the following:

    - How does this news make you feel? Do you feel:
        - celebratory?
        - encouraged?
        - angry?
        - happy or pleased?
        - sad?
        - curious?
        - amazed?
        - hungry?
    - Who are the people most involved or affected by this?
    - Does this affect me? Why or why not?
    - How do we learn more?

6. When the conversation has come to a stop, move to the next topic.

7. Congratulate you and your team for engaging in critical discussion! This requires openness, vulnerability, and effort.

## Separation From Current Events

The current news we bring and discuss is not necessarily a reflection of who we are.

## Content Warning Requirement

Partaking in conversations about current events often means engaging with material that can trigger a strong or potentially harmful emotional response in you or someone else.

## Trust Yourself and Others

A content warning slide should not discourage you from bringing any current event article. As a community, we keep each other safe by faithfully describing content warnings. We must trust ourselves and our community members that we will disengage when needed, given proper content warning notice.
