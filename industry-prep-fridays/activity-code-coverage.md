# Activity: Code Coverage

## Learning Goals

* Explain the concept of code coverage
* Use `pytest-cov` to create a test coverage report
* Use the test coverage report to debug code

## Introduction

Code coverage is a term that is used to describe how much application code is executed when a particular test suite is run. A test suite with a high percentage of coverage is likely to be testing more throughly and have fewer bugs. A code coverage tool can partner with our testing suite to give us a report illustrating the coverage of our tests.
