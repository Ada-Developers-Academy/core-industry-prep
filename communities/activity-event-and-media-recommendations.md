# Activity: Event and Media Recommendations

## Goal

We can grow and nurture our connection to tech!

One way to nurture a connection to something is to find others in similar positions and/or with similar interests.

We can get a better glimpse into the cool work being done in tech by finding:

- Events that interest us, and let us meet others
- Media that interests us, and lets us listen to others and their work

In this activity, each of us are asked to find and bring three recommendations to the group:

1. One tech-related event that interests us
1. Two tech-related pieces of media that interest us

## Preparation

There should be two empty slide decks prepared:

1. One slide deck for everyone to put their event recommendations
1. One slide deck for everyone to put their media recommendations

**The slide decks should be configured to auto-advance every thirty seconds**.

## Presentations Will Be Short and Low-Stakes

## Activity Instructions

Spend around 25 minutes finding recommendations and creating slides for them:

1. Follow the directions below to find one recommended event, and create one slide for it.
1. Follow the directions below to find two recommended works of media, and create one slide for each recommendation.

Follow the facilitator's directions for the presentation.

- When any of your slides comes up, describe what the recommendation is, and why you recommend it.
- You may pass your turn by saying "pass."
- You may end your turn early by saying "pass."
- You will have a **maximum of 30 seconds per slide**.
