* Variable names are not descriptive
* Some spacing issues

##### !end-rubric

##### !explanation

Some things you may find:

* Some variable names are in camelCase
* Some variable names are not descriptive
* Some spacing issues, for example `x=x//10` instead of `x = x // 10`

<!-- Question 2 -->

### !challenge

* type: paragraph
* id: 9fc8f407-17e7-48d4-8077-ba468e183c03
* title: What efficiency issues did you find?
* points: 1
* topics: python, code-reviews

##### !question

What efficiency issues did you find?

##### !end-question

##### !placeholder

What efficiency issues did you find?

##### !end-placeholder

##### !rubric

Students should find the following efficiency issues:

* `twoSum` involves nested loops and O(n^2) time complexity
* `merge_sorted_arrays` merges the two lists without using the fact that the input lists are already sorted resulting in O(n log n) time complexity instead of O(n).

##### !explanation

* `twoSum` involves nested loops and O(n^2) time complexity
* `merge_sorted_arrays` merges the two lists without using the fact that the input lists are already sorted resulting in O(n log n) time complexity instead of O(n).

* title: What testing issues did you find?
* points: 1
* topics: python, code-reviews, testing

##### !question

What testing issues did you find?

What testing issues did you find?

##### !end-placeholder

##### !rubric

Students should find the following testing issues:

* No function has all of it's edge-cases covered

##### !end-rubric

##### !explanation

These are *some*, not all, of the issues present:

* `twoSum` tests do not cover the instance where no two numbers add up to the target.
* `palindrome_number` tests do not cover one digit numbers, or negative numbers.
* `merge_sorted_arrays` tests do not cover the case where the two lists are both empty, or contain overlapping elements.
