# What to Expect in Algorithm Sessions

### We will be practicing the following goals:

* **Talking code**. It's not enough to know internally what your code is doing. You should be able to explain your logic flow to your algorithm partner. This should be a conversation and a collaboration.

  *The more you practice, the smoother it will become.*

* **Thinking logically, not "correctly."** Follow your instincts and solve problems unconventionally. There is no one way to solve these algorithms, so don't limit yourself to the "best" or "right" way.

* **It's OK if you've got no clue!** Sometimes you will be hit with an algorithm that makes you go, "nope!" Happens to everyone. Don't let that stop you from working on the pieces you do know. Trying is what strengthens your algorithm muscles!

* **Having a solution isn't the end all, be all.** Sure, it's nice to have, but a solution in a vacuum won't help you. Focus on *understanding* the logic to get to a solution, not the other way around.
