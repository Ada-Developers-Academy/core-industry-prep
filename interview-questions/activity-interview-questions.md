# Activity: Interview Questions

## Goal

Our goal is to compile a series of interview question resources and interview questions.

## Preparation

The facilitator should make a spreadsheet that includes everyone's name, and allows students to notate at least two questions. For example:

| Name | Question #1 | Question #2 |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
|      |             |

The facilitator should also prepare a way to record ideas in part one. Some recommended methods include:

- The word cloud feature of [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)
- Taking notes on a shared document

## Activity Instructions

There are two parts to this activity:

1. Crowdsource interview resources
1. Crowdsource interview questions

### Crowdsource Resources

As a large group, follow directions from the facilitator to create a shared list of interview question resources.

These resources may include:

- Websites made for technical interview preparation
- Newsletters made for technical interview preparation
- Recommended books

If it includes practice interview questions, then it's valid!

### Crowdsource Questions

Individually find and share practice questions. Everyone must contribute at least _two_ questions to the shared document of practice questions.

- One must be a coding question
- The second may be a behavioral question
- There can be overlap or repetition with other entries in the document.

For each coding question, include a link to its original source if possible. For example:

| Name         | Question #1                                                                 | Question #2                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eamonn Finch | [Roman Numeral to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/) | Describe a time when you were working with someone and there was a conflict. What happened, and what was the resolution? |

#### Tips

Begin with looking for questions that are:

- Marked as "easy"
- Centered around:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Hash Tables
  - Sorting

## Your Mileage May Vary

Online interview prep material can target entry-level developers or senior-level developers. There are interview questions that target general programming, software development, or computer science, and some that target specific subjects, such as networking or databases.
<br/>
Finding interview questions is an imperfect process. Sometimes a question we find targets the wrong skill level or subject material, and we don't realize this until we're doing our interview practice. Sometimes, a question we find is in a different programming language!
<br/>
Even after coming across a few strange interview questions, keep persisting! Getting presented with unlikely problems and learning how to assess an appropriate interview question for you is part of the process. Don't aim for perfection, aim for practice!
